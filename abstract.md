The 2020 Atlantic Hurricane season set a record for the most named storms at 30. Once the 2021 season finished at 21, it marked the first time ever that the English named storm list was exhausted in back to back seasons. 2021 also marked the 6th consecutive year of above-average activity. Anthropogenic climate change (ACC) may play a role in causing these unusually active hurricane seasons. In this paper, we prove the existence of a causal relationship using counterfactual causal theory (CCT). We employ the use of in-silico experimentation to provide a realization of a counterfactual world without the effects of ACC and use strategies utilized in recent literature regarding applying CCT to demonstrate the causation of ACC on other climate phenomena. We also evaluate the use of more recent developments in CCT not yet applied in this space, as well as compare our method to non-counterfactual methods in the space of linking ACC to increased hurricane activity. With these contributions, we hope to improve the existing framework of identifying causes of climate phenomena, which can aid in strategizing mitigation efforts.
