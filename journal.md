Today I have begun conducting a literature review, which I would like to use to be able to make more concrete
the specific goals of my project, refine my abstract, and be able to construct some sort of an outline of steps
that would be needed so I can give myself a proper timeline for the project.

Here are some of the links to the papers I have been reading:

Last week I read over several papers, mostly the ones listed above plus a couple more recent ones that are to be added, and began to construct a prelimiary outline. I am finishing up some notes on those papers as well. I will aim to publish a more polished problem statement, with inputs, outputs, and outline by early next week.
