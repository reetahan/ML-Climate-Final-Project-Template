Today I have begun conducting a literature review, which I would like to use to be able to make more concrete
the specific goals of my project, refine my abstract, and be able to construct some sort of an outline of steps
that would be needed so I can give myself a proper timeline for the project.

Here are some of the links to the papers I have been reading:

Last week I read over several papers, mostly the ones listed above plus a couple more recent ones that are to be added, and began to construct a prelimiary outline. I am finishing up some notes on those papers as well. I will aim to publish a more polished problem statement, with inputs, outputs, and outline by early next week.

The paper listing has been updated. This week has been a rather busy one for me so I do not have much in the way of updates.

Problem Statement: We want to determine a quantified degree of attribution that humans have had on the last two Atlantic hurricane seasons, some of the most active in history. We can use counterfactual causal inference theory in order to deem this, provided we can acquire the appropriate data. In order to come up with the "counterfactual" side of the data to attempt an evaluation, we can use simulation software and modelling such as FLOR by   Simulations that 

Input: Data representing key statistics to inform of the overall intensity of the 2020 and 2021 Atlantic Hurricane seasons, such as ACE, as well as model simulated data from AOML to represent hurricane seasons with lesser degrees of climate change

Output: Degree of attribution anthropogenic climate change claims for these hurricane seasons.


Rough Outline:

March 1 - Complete formalization of methodology of inference process, may try to make novel method that builds on top of methods I have read in papers in addition to what I have learned in class

March 15 - Complete usage and training of simulation software to generate desired counterfactual output of choice (the factual data is already present and available)

March 30 - Run full counterfactual analysis and consider trying alternate/refining methodology if needed

April 15 - Extra time to re-run experiments, make adjustments, etc, Complete video.

May 1 (?) - Complete paper.
